# Fix Container Padding Issue

## Problem

The information display cards (Bookmark Count, Tier, Processing Flow, Estimated Cost, Estimated Time) have insufficient padding, making the content appear cramped against the container borders.

## Solution

Increase the padding on the following containers in `popup.html`:

1. **Metrics Display Card** (line 76)

- Change from `p-3` to `p-4`
- This affects: Bookmark Count, Tier, Processing Flow

2. **Cost & Time Estimate Cards** (lines 93, 97)

- Change from `p-3` to `p-4`
- This affects: Estimated Cost and Estimated Time cards

## Files to Modify

- `/Users/amohii/dev/UI-update-ai-bookmar-enhancer/ai-bookmark-enhancer/popup.html`

## Changes

The padding will increase from 12px to 16px, providing better visual breathing room while maintaining the overall design aesthetic.
