# Fix Consent Modal Scroll Issue

## Problem

The consent modal content was not scrollable, causing the submit buttons to be hidden off-screen when the modal content exceeded the viewport height. Users could see the scrollbar but couldn't scroll to reveal the buttons at the bottom.

## Root Cause

Two issues were preventing proper scrolling:
1. The modal container was missing `overflow-hidden`, which is required for flex containers with `max-h` constraints
2. The modal content container had `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` but was missing `min-h-0`. Without `min-h-0`, flex children won't shrink below their content size

## Solution

Made two changes:
1. Added `overflow-hidden` to the modal container to constrain overflow properly
2. Added `min-h-0` to the modal content container to allow proper flex shrinking and scrolling

```268:268:popup.html
    <div class="w-[400px] max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)] bg-slate-900/95 backdrop-blur-xl border border-white/10 rounded-2xl shadow-2xl m-4 flex flex-col overflow-hidden">
```

```285:285:popup.html
      <div class="p-4 space-y-4 flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0">
```

## Files Modified

- `/Users/amohii/dev/UI-update-ai-bookmar-enhancer/ai-bookmark-enhancer/popup.html` (lines 268, 285)

## Result

The modal now properly scrolls its content while keeping the header and footer (with submit buttons) always visible and accessible.
