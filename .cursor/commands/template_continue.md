I'm continuing work on my Chrome extension UI transformation.

Current status:

- Spec file: UI-TRANSFORMATION-SPEC.md
- Last completed task: [mention task number]
- Current phase: [mention phase number]

Please:

1. Read the spec file to see what's marked [X] (completed)
2. Find the next [ ] (not started) task
3. Continue from there
4. Work through the current phase
5. Update the spec with your progress

Let me know when you need me to review before moving to the next phase.
