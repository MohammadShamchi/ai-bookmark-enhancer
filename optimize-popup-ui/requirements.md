# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Optimize the popup UI for better performance, compact design, and improved user experience by implementing simplified styles, reduced dimensions, and performance-focused changes as per the provided CSS feedback. This will prevent scrolling issues, reduce visual complexity, and enhance loading speed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a compact and fixed-size popup, so that it fits consistently within browser constraints without unexpected scrolling or resizing.

2. WHEN content is added THEN the system SHALL maintain fixed dimensions without expanding.
3. WHEN viewing on smaller screens THEN the system SHALL adjust responsively while maintaining core layout.
4. WHEN scrolling is attempted THEN the system SHALL prevent both horizontal and vertical scrolling.
5. WHEN elements overflow THEN the system SHALL handle them with hidden overflow or auto scrolling in designated areas.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want simplified and performant visual effects, so that the UI loads quickly without unnecessary animations or complex backgrounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup renders THEN the system SHALL use simplified background gradients with reduced opacity.
2. WHEN hovering elements THEN the system SHALL use fast transitions without complex animations.
3. WHEN loading THEN the system SHALL remove or simplify particle effects and reflections.
4. WHEN interacting THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance with optimized CSS properties.
5. WHEN viewing status THEN the system SHALL use simple pulse animations without heavy effects.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want optimized spacing and typography, so that the interface feels clean and readable without wasted space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing text THEN the system SHALL use refined spacing variables from 6px to 32px.
2. WHEN reading labels THEN the system SHALL apply smaller font sizes (10-14px) for better density.
3. WHEN seeing borders THEN the system SHALL use smaller radius values (8-20px) for subtle curves.
4. WHEN elements are grouped THEN the system SHALL maintain minimum gaps without excessive padding.
5. WHEN content is dense THEN the system SHALL ensure readability with proper line heights and weights.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want debug and control buttons, so that I can easily test and manage the extension state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide visible debug and force-unlock buttons.
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL show an emergency stop button with proper styling.
3. WHEN resetting THEN the system SHALL include a reset button with consistent design.
4. WHEN buttons are hovered THEN the system SHALL apply subtle scale and shadow effects.
