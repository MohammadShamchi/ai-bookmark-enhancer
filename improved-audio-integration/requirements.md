## Introduction

This feature improves the audio feedback system in the Chrome extension by replacing synthetic generated tones with high-quality WAV sound effects. The current sounds are perceived as overused or not optimal, so we'll integrate provided audio files (mixkit-magical-light-sweep-2586.wav, mixkit-on-or-off-light-switch-tap-2585.wav, mixkit-sparkle-hybrid-transition-3060.wav) to enhance user experience during interactions like button clicks, hovers, success, error, and processing states.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the extension popup, I want improved, more engaging sound effects for actions, so that the interface feels more modern and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over a button THEN the system SHALL play a subtle sparkle transition sound (mixkit-sparkle-hybrid-transition-3060.wav).
2. WHEN the user clicks a button THEN the system SHALL play a light switch tap sound (mixkit-on-or-off-light-switch-tap-2585.wav).
3. WHEN an operation succeeds THEN the system SHALL play a magical light sweep sound (mixkit-magical-light-sweep-2586.wav).
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL play an appropriate error sound (to be determined or reused).
5. WHEN processing is ongoing THEN the system SHALL play a processing indicator sound.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the extension, I want the SoundManager to support WAV file playback, so that we can easily integrate and manage custom audio assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing SoundManager THEN the system SHALL load the provided WAV files from the Audio directory.
2. WHEN playing a sound THEN the system SHALL use HTML5 Audio objects to play the preloaded WAV files.
3. WHEN audio context is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable sounds without errors.
4. WHEN switching sounds THEN the system SHALL ensure no overlap or audio glitches.
5. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL check for audio file existence and handle missing files appropriately.
