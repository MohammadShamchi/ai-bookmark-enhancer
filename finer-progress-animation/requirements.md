## Introduction

This feature adds a visual animation to the progress bar during API calls to indicate ongoing activity, preventing the UI from appearing frozen while waiting for OpenAI responses during chunk processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual feedback during waiting periods, so that I know the process is active and not frozen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a chunk API call THEN the system SHALL start a pulsing or loading animation on the progress bar.
2. WHEN API call completes THEN the system SHALL stop the animation and update actual progress.
3. WHEN in running state THEN the system SHALL show indeterminate progress if no specific percentage available.
4. WHEN error occurs THEN the system SHALL stop animation and show error.
5. WHEN process starts THEN the system SHALL initialize animation state.
