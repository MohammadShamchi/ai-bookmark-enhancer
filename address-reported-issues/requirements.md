# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses multiple technical and user experience issues in the AI Bookmark Organizer extension, including stuck job states, communication errors, lack of processing feedback, and performance optimizations for better reliability and user satisfaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to automatically detect and reset stuck job states, so that I can always start new operations without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN popup opens and job is in 'running' state but older than 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL reset it to completed or error.
2. WHEN extension reloads THEN the system SHALL clear any running jobs.
3. WHEN job hasn't updated in 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL timeout and reset.
4. WHEN detecting stuck state THEN the system SHALL log the event.
5. WHEN reset occurs THEN the system SHALL notify the user.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback during long operations, so that I know the extension is working and not frozen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organization starts THEN the system SHALL show a progress bar with animation.
2. WHEN processing API calls THEN the system SHALL display "Processing..." with pulsing indicator.
3. WHEN chunk completes THEN the system SHALL update progress percentage.
4. WHEN operation takes >10s THEN the system SHALL show estimated time remaining if possible.
5. WHEN idle THEN the system SHALL hide progress indicators.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want error recovery options, so that I can reset and retry failed operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error occurs THEN the system SHALL display error message with reset button.
2. WHEN user clicks reset THEN the system SHALL clear job state and enable buttons.
3. WHEN communication error happens THEN the system SHALL retry once automatically.
4. WHEN multiple errors THEN the system SHALL suggest checking API key or network.
5. WHEN recovery succeeds THEN the system SHALL show success message.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance optimizations, so that the extension handles large bookmark sets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bookmarks >500 THEN the system SHALL process in smaller chunks of 50.
2. WHEN API calls THEN the system SHALL use efficient prompts to minimize tokens.
3. WHEN moving bookmarks THEN the system SHALL batch operations.
4. WHEN large set detected THEN the system SHALL warn user about time.
5. WHEN complete THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary data.
