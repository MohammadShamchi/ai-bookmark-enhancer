## Introduction

This feature enhances user experience by displaying real-time progress during the bookmark organization process. Currently, users wait without feedback; we'll add a progress bar and status messages showing completion percentage. Additionally, to improve performance, we'll suggest optimizations like bookmark chunking and efficient API usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user organizing bookmarks, I want to see a progress indicator, so that I know how much of the process is complete and can estimate wait time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organization starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar in the popup.
2. WHEN processing chunks THEN the system SHALL update the progress bar based on processed chunks vs total.
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL show error message and stop progress.
4. WHEN process completes THEN the system SHALL fill the progress bar to 100% and show success message.
5. WHEN no bookmarks are present THEN the system SHALL show immediate completion.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance optimizations, so that the organization process is efficient and handles large bookmark sets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing bookmarks THEN the system SHALL process them in chunks of 50-100 to avoid API limits.
2. WHEN calling AI API THEN the system SHALL use efficient prompts and minimal tokens.
3. WHEN applying changes THEN the system SHALL batch bookmark moves for better performance.
4. WHEN detecting large sets (>1000) THEN the system SHALL warn user about potential time.
5. WHEN idle THEN the system SHALL clean up any temporary data.
